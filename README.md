# [ChitChat-Renewd](https://shity-chat.netlify.app)

Simple chat application with Socket.io and [JDb](https://github.com/spuckhafte/Jdb-v2)

## Update
I rebuilt it using **[JDb](https://github.com/spuckhafte/Jdb-v2)**<br>
So basically the messages gets stored in JSON files.<br>
Whenever you reload it should load previously stored messages and should store your account.<br>

## Problem
I hosted it on **heroku** and all the files get **reset** whenever the server sleeps (due to 30 minutes of inactivity)
